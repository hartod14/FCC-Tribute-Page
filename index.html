                <p><strong>Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie</strong> was an Indonesian engineer and politician who was the
                    third president of Indonesia from 1998 to 1999. Less than three months after his inauguration as the
                    seventh vice president in March 1998, he succeeded Suharto who resigned after 31 years in office.
                    His presidency is seen as a landmark and transition to the Reformation era. Upon becoming president,
                    he liberalized Indonesia's press and political party laws, and held an early democratic election
                    three years sooner than scheduled, which resulted in the end of his presidency.

                                Pare Pare in the Indonesian state of South Sulawesi. The fourth of eight children, he
                                was nicknamed "Rudy" at an early age. His father, Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie, was a

                                grandfather was a Muslim leader and an affluent landowner</p>

                            <p>Suharto asked Habibie to return to Indonesia to help establish an industrial base.
                                Habibie jump-started an aircraft construction industry and a state airline company. Soon
                                he became Suharto's chief advisor for high-technology development. Habibie exploited the
                                relationships he had developed in Germany and NATO to engineer a myriad of controversial
                                deals involving aircraft, ships, heavy industry, and economic development.</p>
